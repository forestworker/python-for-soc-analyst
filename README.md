## Lesson 1: `print()` and First Script

```python
print("Hello, SOC World!")
```

---

## Lesson 2: Variables and Data Types

```python
my_name = "Dawid"
age = 32
wants_to_be_soc1 = True

print(my_name)
print(age)
print(wants_to_be_soc1)
```

---

## Lesson 3: Operations and `input()`

```python
name = input("What is your name? ")
age = int(input("How old are you? "))

print(f"{name}, in 5 years you will be {age + 5} years old.")
```

---

## Lesson 4: Conditional Statements `if`, `elif`, `else`

```python
name = input("What is your name? ")
failed_logins = int(input("Enter number of failed login attempts: "))

if failed_logins >= 5:
    print(f"ALERT! Possible brute-force attack on account {name}!")
elif failed_logins >= 3:
    print(f"Warning {name}, suspicious activity detected.")
else:
    print(f"All clear, {name}.")
```

---

## Lesson 5: Lists, Loops and `zip()`

```python
names = ["Dawid", "Ola", "Gosia"]
attempts = [1, 3, 5]

for name, num_attempts in zip(names, attempts):
    if num_attempts >= 5:
        print(f"ALERT! {name} had {num_attempts} failed login attempts!")
    elif num_attempts >= 3:
        print(f"Warning: {name} had {num_attempts} failed logins.")
    else:
        print(f"OK: {name} had only {num_attempts} attempts.")
```

---

## Lesson 6 (bonus): Log File Reading

Example contents of `logs.txt`:

```
2025-07-25 12:00 - INFO - Dawid logged in
2025-07-25 12:01 - WARNING - Ola entered wrong password
2025-07-25 12:02 - ERROR - Intrusion attempt from IP: 192.168.1.13
```

```python
with open("logs.txt", "r") as file:
    for line in file:
        if "ERROR" in line:
            print("ALERT! Error found:", line.strip())
```
